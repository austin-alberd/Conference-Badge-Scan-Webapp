This is a webapp created with inspiration from the [NOAC Quest Games](https://event.oa-scouting.org/events/noac2022/portal/quest/). The idea behind the game is to drive engagement at conferences or camps by allowing participants to get points by scanning codes on another participants conference badge. These points can then be redeemed for points or bragging rights. Participants are also able to see basic information about the people that they scanned.
